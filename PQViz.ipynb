    "# CODI Prevelance Query (PQ) Results Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background - PQ algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "[CODI-PQ](https://github.com/NORC-UChicago/CODI-PQ) is a program for weight-status-category prevalence based on BMI, and results can be stratified by age, sex, race and geography. PQViz can support the simple output of both PQ (Youth and Teens) and APQ (Adults). This notebook supports outputs from CODI-PQ run individually with no conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## PQViz Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool allows researchers to conduct post-processing and data visualization of CODI-PQ output. It is intended to be used **after** a data set has been processed with CODI-PQ.\n",
    "\n",
    "PQViz is a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). It provides an environment that includes graphical user interfaces as well as interactive software development to explore data. To achieve this, PQViz uses different software languages and packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/) is used to import, transform, visualize and analyze the output of growthcleanr. Some of the code for the tool is directly included in this notebook. Other functions have been placed in external files to minimize the amount of code that users see in order to let them focus on the actual data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * Data analysis is performed using [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). The output of PQViz will be loaded into a [Pandas DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html). It is expected that users will create views into or copies of the DataFrames built initially by this tool. Adding columns to the DataFrames created by this tool is unlikely to cause problems. Removing columns is likely to break some of the tool's functionality.\n",
    "   \n",
    "  * Visualization in the tool is provided by [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/). Users may generate their own charts with these utilities.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * Mapping support is provided by [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/) and [ipyleaflet](https://ipyleaflet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)."
