# Reference Data

This directory contains several files of reference data used in support of
PQViz. These data sources are in the public domain.

## CDC PLACES

The file `cdc-places-zcta-2020.csv.gz` is a compressed export of data from [CDC
PLACES](http://www.cdc.gov/places/). It was obtained in CSV format via this link
in January 2022:

    https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/PLACES-ZCTA-Data-GIS-Friendly-Format-2021-release/kee5-23sr

It is stored compressed to save space and bandwidth, but will be uncompressed
when it is used in PQViz due to a minor quirk in the code used to read it.

## ZIP Code to ZCTA mapping

The file `cdc-places-zcta-2020.csv` isi a CSV export of data from the [ZIP Code
to ZCTA Crosswalk](https://udsmapper.org/zip-code-to-zcta-crosswalk/) available
from the [UDS Mapper](https://udsmapper.org/). It was obtained in Excel format
in January 2022 and converted to CSV manually.

## State boundary files

The directory `state-boundaries` includes one geojson file containing the ZCTA
boundaries for the 50 US states plus DC. These are derived from the US Census
[Cartographic Boundary
Files](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/cartographic-boundary.2019.html),
and the [UDS Mapper ZCTA to ZIP Code
Crosswalk](https://udsmapper.org/zip-code-to-zcta-crosswalk/) data. A Python
script in this directory, `create-state-boundaries.py`, uses these files to
generate the individual state files and a set of extents for each state for use
within the notebook. The script has been used to create the files present in
this directory, which were also compressed to save space, and the use of the
script is not required to use the notebook itself. It is included to support
potential maintenance. See the script for additional details on its use.
